#steps to importing libraries in cpp
1. Use find_package to locate libraries.
e.g. find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
2. Use ament_target_dependencies or target_link_libraries to link dependencies.
e.g. ament_target_dependencies(perception_node_cpp OpenCV)
3. Use target_include_directories to include headers if needed.
e.g. target_include_directories(perception_node_cpp ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
4. Ensure proper linking (static or shared libraries) based on your needs.
e.g. target_link_libraries(perception_node_cpp ${OpenCV_LIBS})

OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS - contains the directories where OpenCV's header files (e.g., opencv2/opencv.hpp) are located
OpenCV_LIBS - contains the paths to the compiled OpenCV libraries (e.g., opencv_core, opencv_imgproc, opencv_highgui) that need to be linked to your executable or library

#steps to import .hpp files

1. Place .hpp file in the install directory 
2. #include "<file_name>.hpp"
3. Add the install directory to the include path in the CMakeLists.txt file
e.g.
target_include_directories(perception_node_cpp
    PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
)
